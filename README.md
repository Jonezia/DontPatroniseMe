# DontPatroniseMe

Work done for Imperial College NLP Coursework. We analyse the "Don't Patronize Me!" dataset used in the SemEval 2022 competition. We use this to develop a binary classification model to predict
whether a text contains patronising and condescending language. This is achieved through a transformer architecture combined with data preprocessing including sampling and data augmentation.
